# Anakindlosism

The term "anakindlosism" lends to the archaic Greek words "ana-" meaning "again", and "kindulos" meaning "lamp", serving to elucidate the meaning "relighting" which is the aim of this book, to attempt to reveal again to humanity what unites them within this creation. We have been through various enlightenments, which have illuminated our paths and seared structures into our memories and our imaginations, but we must now proceed from the match to the candle, and then from the candle to the oil-lamp. Let it be known to all that our enlightenment of our surroundings does not come anywhere near to full lighting, and that there is so much more left to see. Anyone reading these words with the belief that we know all that is to be known will trip and fall. Anyone reading these words with the belief that the mysteries are inaccessible to us will hide in the corner. These words are intended for those who know there is more to see, who who are excited to proceed through the exploration.
